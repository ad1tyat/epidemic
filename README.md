# Quadtree based Epidemic Information Dissemination Visualiser

## Work in Progress, Will be hosted as a live web app soon !

## About

- a web app to show how information is disseminated among agents in close proximity â€‘ modelled as an **epidemic**
- Users can interact and adjust various parameters to simulate scenarios
- agents can be random or in a pre-set environment - crossroads, coridoors, etc. 
- **[Quadtrees](https://github.com/ad1tyat/quadtree)** are used to exploit proximity among agents and make computations faster
- inspired by this 2004 [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1297243/) on epidemic information dissemination in distributed systems.
